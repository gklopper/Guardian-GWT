        <body type="html">&lt;p&gt;Green groups waiting for Tony Blair&apos;s first speech on the environment in almost four years yesterday challenged the prime minister to admit that Labour had failed to advance many environmental issues since coming to power. Charles Secrett, director of Friends of the Earth, said: &quot;He and his inner circle still think that the environmental agenda is against people, against science, against business and against the poor. It&apos;s a desperately outdated social democrat myth.&quot;   Mr Blair promised in 1997 to &quot;put concern for the environment at the heart of Labour policy-making&quot;, after criticising the Tories&apos; environmental record.  But he has turned to openly blaming major lobby groups for opposing him over GM, traffic reduction, fuel duties, waste, and road safety. He is widely expected to accuse the environment groups of &quot;dogma&quot; later today.  One view, backed by No 10, is that Labour had too many other priorities, such as education and health, to deal with in their first term and would   move firmly behind a fuller environmental agenda during a second term.  But the goodwill on both sides has evaporated, with Mr Blair&apos;s advisers questioning green groups&apos; authority and the groups in turn accusing him of running scared.  Lord Melchett, director of Greenpeace, said : &quot;With John Prescott and Michael Meacher Labour has got the most committed environment team ever. Yet there&apos;s a view in certain parts of the party of environment being an old Labour preoccupation. It&apos;s so ignorant, it&apos;s hard to believe.&quot;   &quot;It&apos;s been all spin without the substance&quot;, a Green party spokesman said.  &quot;Mr Blair appointed an oil mogul &amp;#91;Lord Simon of BP&amp;#93; as a minister of competitiveness and an avowed GM enthusiast &amp;#91;Lord Sainsbury&amp;#93; as a minister of science.  &quot;He takes advice from people who would gain from not addressing environmental concerns. He has failed to address the social and economic cases for environmental policies.&quot;  Lynn Sloman of Transport 2000 said: &quot;Labour started with a huge commitment to   tackle transport but, although the department of the environment has done really good work, No 10 is now running scared of the extreme motorists&apos; lobby&quot;.  Damian Green, the Conservative environment spokesman, yesterday praised Mr Meacher but said that &quot;when he goes up to Blair there&apos;s just nothing there. Blair doesn&apos;t think &amp;#91;environment&amp;#93; is an important issue.&quot;  The specific charges are that Mr Blair and his close advisers have been more concerned with winning over the business community than with effecting real environmental improvements. The marginalisation of the environment came, they say, weeks after Mr Blair&apos;s only speech on the environment when he ditched the In Trust for Tomorrow policy paper which was considered progressive.  Since then, Mr Blair and No 10 have scotched the fuel escalator tax, blocked minimal targets for traffic reduction and rejected a pesticide tax which would have penalised rich farmers.  On GM, they say, Mr Blair&apos;s support for the controversial technology sought to appease the US and large companies over the genuine concerns of the majority of people. No 10 has also, they say, specifically said &quot;yes&quot; to heavier lorries and backed down on action to reduce speeds.  They also accuse Mr Blair of running scared of tackling congestion, preferring to try to limit the growth in car numbers, reintroducing a road building policy by stealth and not recognising the potential of alternative energies.  But there is widespread approval of the Department for the Environment, which has pushed through the wildlife and countryside bill which protects habitats and allows walkers access to hundreds of thousands of acres previously denied them.  More surprisingly, there is growing support for the Treasury, which has introduced a series of environmental taxes, and the Department of Trade and Industry.  Lord Melchett said: &quot;Until recently, the DTI was the evil empire, little better than under the Tories.  &quot;But Stephen Byers has made some very significant shifts, even calling for a green industrial revolution.&quot; Labour&apos;s balance sheet Transport For The 10 year transport spending plan should eventually improve public transport and will make more money available for traffic management schemes. Plans to allow local authorities to levy money via road pricing and car parking are in the pipeline. More money has gone to local authorities for transport plans.   Against The number of car journeys is still rising, leading to more congestion and environmental problems. Public transport has still not improved much. The 10 year plan also raises the prospect of a return to widespread road building, which may be bitterly resisted by local communities.    Food  For The government has set up the independent food standards agency and tried to educate the public over nutrition. There has been a small rise in the level of support for organic farming and a glimmering of understanding that environmentally sensitive farming pays social and economic dividends.   Against  Agriculture is in long-term crisis with the smallest farms going under. The government has consistently backed GM technology and is proceeding as fast as politically possible with its commercial development.   Energy  For The government announced a 10% target for renewable energy by 2010, a significant improvement on the previous government.   Against The 10% target is welcome but does not go nearly far enough. The   Commons environment committee and Friends of the Earth have argued for a 20% target by 2010.   Wildlife and countryside  For Labour&apos;s significant green contribution should now go through parliament early next month. The countryside and rights of way bill gives legal protection to Britain&apos;s finest wildlife sites. There has also been action to defend peatlands.   Economy  For Labour, says Friends of the Earth, has begun to understand the idea that the quality of economic growth matters, not just its quantity. The 1999 Budget contained more than 20 green measures: taxes on pollution and waste, and reduced taxes on employment. There have also been moves towards putting taxes on aggregates, landfill and company cars.   Climate change  For Tony Blair is credited with taking a lead on reducing carbon emissions, the main greenhouse warming gas. Labour has promised to cut carbon dioxide emissions by 2010 by 20% from 1990 levels. The government eventually gave tacit support to the warm homes bill, designed to end the scandal of fuel poverty and excess winter deaths.   Against  The government is likely to fail to meet its 20% target. Ministers failed to argue the climate case during the recent fuel protests.   Pollution and health  For The government has produced the first targets for household recycling.   Against  The government has also left the door open for dozens of new waste incinerators that are bitterly opposed by communities nearby.&lt;/p&gt;</body>

      <type-specific class="article">
        <body type="html">&lt;p&gt;As he sets out his case for electing him the next Liberal Democrat leader Sir Menzies Campbell does not sound like a man recovering from a mauling in the Commons. He knew that when he stood in for Charles Kennedy at prime minister&apos;s question time on Wednesday he would be jeered by Labour and Tory MPs whatever he said. He was not disappointed.But Sir Ming - as everyone calls him since Menzies is pronounced &quot;Minges&quot; by fellow-Scots - shows a steely side when challenged about his age and commitment to the job. &quot;There ain&apos;t no secret about my age and there ain&apos;t no secret about my health. I&apos;ve been totally open &amp;#91;about his cancer in 2002-03&amp;#93;. People have got to look at me and decide if I have the stamina and commitment to do the job. If I didn&apos;t think I had the stamina, and the ability, I would not be putting myself forward,&quot; he told the Guardian in his first full interview of the leadership campaign.In the interview he talks about his modest family background, his choice of career and his whirlwind three-month courtship and marriage to Elspeth (the daughter of a second world war hero who was played by Sean Connery in the film about the Arnhem landings in 1944, A Bridge Too Far.) His mother was a brilliant hockey player who might have played for Scotland had she not been forced to go out to work. His father, a leftwing voter in the old Independent Labour party would also have gone to university if money had not been tight in his Glasgow childhood. He ended up running Glasgow corporation&apos;s building department, which maintained the largest stock of council housing in the country - 6,000 staff and 250 in head office alone. Sir Ming&apos;s childhood became one of the comfortable Glasgow middle class. From his mother he got his enthusiasm and skill for sport, after being made to listen on the radio to the 1948 London Olympics.He is determined to show how determined he has been to get where he got, a successful barrister who built up his career from nothing - as his friend John Smith, Labour&apos;s late leader, did. Both men worked at the Glasgow criminal bar doing uncontested divorce work on Saturdays in the days when adultery, cruelty and desertion were the main grounds.&quot;There was a lot of political talk at home, but my parents were not activists,&quot; he recalls. When he went to Glasgow University to do a general arts degree - before doing three more years on a law degree - he joined the debating society organised on party lines. &quot;I&apos;d been a school debater, so my first act of rebellion was to join the Liberal party. It was not a very big rebellion, but it was a start. But I did it with a genuine sense of conviction. Scottish Labour in those days was pretty unreconstucted, dominated by heavy industry. There was a lot of socialism in the Labour party in Scotland ... that put me off. But I was never a Tory. They say I look like a Tory? Remember the famous Jeremy Thorpe dictum &apos;look right, think left&apos;.&quot;He talks about his Olympic career which took him into the 4x100 metres final at the 1964 Tokyo games when he was still a student and later saw Jeffrey Archer - now Lord Archer - joining his squad. But its purpose is to underline the former sprinter&apos;s determination, which he says is evident in all aspects of his career. He recalls how he won North East Fife, once the seat of the last Liberal prime minister, Herbert Asquith, in 1987 at the third attempt - his fifth parliamentary campaign - when he was 46.&quot;It took me 11 years to win my seat, three elections and 50,000 miles of driving. To those who might wonder if I am committed to things I would offer that. I would also say that you do not compete in top-class athletics without a hell of a lot of work, particularly if you had as little natural ability as I had. And the bar, hard work, commitment, perseverance.&quot;Campbell&apos;s main message is that, if elected between now and early March, he will not waste time, as his old friend Paddy Ashdown did (with his support) when dealing with Tony Blair before 1997, on talk of hung parliaments (&quot;I don&apos;t believe it&quot;) or of coalitions with Labour or the Tories. &quot;The only project I would embark upon, were I to become leader, is maximisation of the vote and maximisation of the seats,&quot; he stresses. He condemns Tony Blair for moving too far to the right since becoming prime minister and accuses David Cameron of being &quot;no liberal&quot;.Sir Menzies is interviewed in his own office in Portcullis House, Westminster. Though acting leader he has resisted moving into Mr Kennedy&apos;s &quot;bunker&quot; above the Commons chamber. As frontrunner he hopes to win, but is too experienced a hand to assume anything. He recalls how in 1999 he was told a &quot;direct lie&quot; by his close friend Paddy Ashdown. &quot;I took him out to dinner and he said: &apos;I have no intention of going&apos; - then resigned a week later. It wasn&apos;t personal, he just wanted to keep his cards close to his chest. It meant that Mr Kennedy was better placed to win. I had no organisation, no strategy and Charles was well ahead. I didn&apos;t think there was any point in putting my hat into the ring.&quot;It is different this time. Campbell insists there was no plot to oust Mr Kennedy, whose colleagues had been loyal throughout his problem with drink, but does not want to make a difficult time worse while bruises are still fresh. &quot;I have done my best to fulfil my responsibility to him and to the party in circumstances which were difficult for everyone ... It has been an enormously difficult time and there have been huge conflicts of loyalty. We have to accept the sincerity of intention of people in what it was they tried to do.&quot;Sir Ming also refuses to go far into policy detail at this stage, taking refuge behind the series of policy reviews Mr Kennedy set in train. What are his priorities? &quot;The environment, the environment, the environment,&quot; he replies without hesitation. That and a campaign against poverty.&quot;It&apos;s a scandal that the poorest 10% of people in this country pay higher proportion of their income in tax than the richest 10%. It&apos;s a scandal. It&apos;s a scandal that there are so many people in my constituency who will never get houses.&quot;Does he support Gordon Brown&apos;s tax credits then? &quot;What I am in favour of is using the tax system to maximise opportunity - not to penalise initiative or aspiration. There will be some detail about that in due course ... We have a tax commission at the moment under wise stewardship of Vince Cable. It would be foolish of me to pre-empt that.&quot;He talks too of the need for the Lib Dems to become more consistent in their policies - &quot;from Shetland to the Scilly Islands&quot; - and to be liberal at home and abroad. Didn&apos;t the Lib Dems in Edinburgh, where he lives, oppose road pricing in the city? &quot;There was a referendum, a democratic choice. And people voted against it but did so in the main because public transport infrastructure wasn&apos;t stronger... &amp;#91;Lib Dems&amp;#93; canvassed against on those grounds,&quot; explains Sir Ming.He remains scornful of Tony Blair&apos;s Iraq war and recalls how he was sceptical about the intelligence and the non-UN strategy in 2002 - before the war and his absence with the hip cancer that is now cured. It is &quot;another myth&quot; that he might have backed it if he had not been ill. So are claims that, with his smart suits and manner, he should have been a Tory, or that with Labour friends at Glasgow University, such as John Smith and Donald Dewer, he should have been Labour. He didn&apos;t like Labour, but nor was he tempted by the Tories. &quot;The influence of Jo Grimond, his beautiful voice, his sense of free-thinking, was immensely attractive. The influence of Grimond and John Stuart Mill was indelible.&quot;That was what allowed him to support the Blair-Ashdown project to reunite the left which floundered with the Labour landslide in 1997. &quot;Grimond argued what was necessary was realignment of the left. Not doctrinaire socialism, but a non-doctrinare centre-left party. It was a natural place for the majority of the people.&quot; Sir Ming believes it still is.He cites the famous interwar book, The Strange Death of Liberal England. &quot;Blair subscribed too at one stage - because of divisions of the left, Conservatives had been given most of the last century almost unchallenged. I believed any realignment would have to come from the left. From that point of view I was certainly supportive of the project. But you didn&apos;t have to be Professor Anthony King &amp;#91;the political scientist&amp;#93; to realise that party strategy had come to an end and what really brought it to end was Labour having a majority of 160. For the next few months it was kept going ... but there was no substance to it,&quot; he says with what he admits is hindsight.Significantly for the coming contest he notes: &quot;Blair began pretty well after that &amp;#91;1997&amp;#93;. You could argue that when Ashdown went &amp;#91;in 1999&amp;#93; Blair was free, but Blair began to move in a way which would have made it impossible to sustain any kind of arrangement. To the right. Imperceptible at first, but they &amp;#91;Labour&amp;#93; began to grow away from us.&quot;Insisting that &quot;the game has changed&quot; over the decade he is also dismissive of talk of hung parliaments. &quot;I don&apos;t believe it. I&apos;ve lived through 83. I&apos;ve lived through 87. All these predictions about hung parliaments and what you would do - I simply don&apos;t believe it. Because, in spite of Professor John Curtice&apos;s statistical chances of it, in my view it seems incredibly remote and I would not allow - leave aside whether I was leader - I would not allow debate to be dominated in that way as it was in 83 and 87. The alliance pulled itself to death over this topic. One advantage of longevity is to know a little bit of folk history and perhaps learn from it. &quot;Though he refuses to characterise David Cameron as an opportunist he is fiercely critical of the new Tory leadership. &quot;Here&apos;s something I shall say to you - I know liberals. I have worked with liberals. David Cameron is no liberal. Look at the election manifesto he produced and stood upon. Look at his voting record - he voted for Iraq. Some parts of my &amp;#91;Scots&amp;#93; Presbyterianism have stuck; by their works shall ye know them. What people do, how they cast their votes - that&apos;s where they stand on the political spectrum.&quot;He&apos;s certainly not a liberal on immigration and asylum. He&apos;s not a liberal on the patient&apos;s passport. These things are now thrown away. Question is, if these things are so lightly cast aside, why were they ever adopted? They were adopted by a party which thought it was capable of forming a government ... You are entitled to assume that if it thought it was capable of forming a government, these are the policies it would have implemented. This conversion simply doesn&apos;t carry any credibility.&quot;Yes, I stand for same set of values now as I did when I first heard Jo Grimond and as I did when I first stood. I am a creature of the centre left. Important issue here: Blair&apos;s concerned about legacy - one of Blair&apos;s legacies will be that he has squeezed values out of politics. Along comes Cameron and says essentially &apos;I can do what he&apos;s doing but I&apos;m a better manager&apos;. One thing is certain: there isn&apos;t space for three management companies in the centre of British politics. What&apos;s required for us is a return to values, accompanied by an openness of mind. I&apos;m more for open minds than I am for open-neck shirts.&quot;&quot;This is not self-indulgence. It&apos;s got to be accompanied by intellectual rigour. Our plans plus intellectual rigour should be sufficient to produce a manifesto on which we can attract support of the people of the UK.&quot;&amp;#183; Sir Menzies Campbell on ...Tory tactics: &quot;We will see. We will see if &amp;#91;Cameron&amp;#93; makes it more acceptable. For example, no frontbench Conservative spokesman &amp;#91;with the exception of Andrew Tyrie&amp;#93; has made a statement about rendition or Guantánamo? These are bellwether issues - if you are liberal you are liberal and at home. Liberalism is not something you turn on and turn off at Land&apos;s End.&quot;Tories and Europe: &quot;Cameron says &amp;#91;he is not&amp;#93; going to allow Tory MEPs to be associated with Angela Merkel&apos;s MEPs. If there really is a genuine move &amp;#91;in German politics&amp;#93; why this revulsion in dealing with someone who may be rather better than any of us anticipated and whose members of the European parliament take, I would argue, a more realistic vision of Europe than many. I am also told that &amp;#91;William&amp;#93; Hague &amp;#91;is&amp;#93; given responsibility for establishing closer relations with the Republican party. Which part? The sensible part like &amp;#91;Senator&amp;#93; John McCain or neo-cons like the present administration?&quot;Lib Dem domestic priorities: &quot;The environment. Blair talks about education, education, education. The environment, the environment, the environment. It&apos;s quite noticeable that in public how heightened appreciation and understanding of what the issues are and a greater willingness to accept that action is required. A party that I lead - I&apos;m not going to talk about the detail in full policy - would most certainly have two things: the environment and a campaign against poverty.&quot;We are bloody good at stopping development on the village green and good at getting a new zebra crossing on the high street. We&apos;ve got to take that campaigning and use it on national issues. We should be committed to campaigning with fervour and professionalism on issues. It&apos;s a scandal that the poorest 10% of people in this country pay a higher proportion of their income in tax than the richest 10%. It&apos;s a scandal. It&apos;s a scandal that there are so many people in my constituency who will never get houses.&quot;Tax credits: &quot;What I am in favour of is using the tax system to maximise opportunity - not to penalise initiative or aspiration. There will be some detail about that in due course. The principles that have to be applied are first - tax burden on the poorest has got to be alleviated. Higher tax rates should not be imposed just for the sake of doing so. I start from the presumption we should not increase total tax take - but if there are specific social objectives which can be met then you have to consider using tax for that. My view is firmly that what we need is fairer tax, not higher tax.&quot;&quot;We should get away from the notion that tax and spend are in one corner and reducing taxation in all circumstances is in the other. Life&apos;s not like that.&quot;Lib Dem inconsistency: &quot;I would want Lib Dems to be consistent. We can talk about Shetland or the Scilly Isles - if we are serious about being a national party we need national consistency.&quot;&amp;#91;Were they consistent on road pricing?&amp;#93; &quot;You have to take the public with you. In Edinburgh, where I live, the public were not. Why? Because necessary public transport infrastructure was sadly lacking. There was a referendum - a democratic choice. And people voted against it but did so in the main because public transport infrastructure wasn&apos;t stronger. &amp;#91;Lib Dems&amp;#93; canvassed against on grounds of absence of public transport network. There was a vote. The public were given their opportunity and declined to endorse it.Charles Kennedy: &quot;There are bruises, not made any easier because some are self-inflicted ... It is clear that some things were said and language used which was hurtful and unnecessary. But I think the point had come at which the confluence of events made it inevitable that Charles would have to go. I&apos;ve been deputy leader for nearly three years; I had known about these difficulties for some time. A lot of it was done on a confidential basis, a lot of it was confidential between me and him. And I would not want to breach that even if by failing to do that I was thought somehow to have played a malign role. I have done my best to fulfil my responsibility to him and to the party in circumstances which were difficult for everyone. &quot;&lt;/p&gt;</body>
